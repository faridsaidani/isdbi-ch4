# 🕋 ASAVE: AAOIFI Standard Augmentation & Validation Engine

Welcome to ASAVE, a cutting-edge AI-powered tool designed to enhance and validate Islamic financial standards, specifically focusing on AAOIFI (Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions) standards. This project leverages advanced AI models, such as Google's Gemini, and the LangChain framework to provide insights, suggestions, and validations for financial accounting standards.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **📚 Document Analysis**: Analyze AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) and Shari'ah Standards (SS).
2. **🧠 Ambiguity Detection**: Identify ambiguities or areas for improvement in standards.
3. **💡 AI-Driven Suggestions**: Generate suggestions to improve clarity and compliance.
4. **⚖️ Shari'ah Compliance Validation**: Validate compliance with Shari'ah principles.
5. **🔗 Inter-Standard Consistency**: Ensure consistency between FAS and SS documents.
6. **🌐 Streamlit Interface**: User-friendly web interface for seamless interaction.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. **Initialization**
- Load environment variables from `.env` (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
- Select FAS and SS documents from the `data_pdf/` directory.
- Initialize AI components using the `main_orchestrator.py`.

### 2. **Document Processing**
- PDFs are processed and vectorized using `document_processor.py`.
- Vector stores are created for semantic search and context retrieval.

### 3. **Analysis Workflow**
- **KEEA (Key Element Extraction Agent)**: Identifies ambiguities or focus points in the text.
- **AISGA (AI Standard Generation Agent)**: Suggests improvements and ensures Shari'ah alignment.
- **SCVA (Shari'ah Compliance Validation Agent)**: Validates compliance with Shari'ah principles.
- **ISCCA (Inter-Standard Consistency Check Agent)**: Ensures consistency between FAS and SS.

### 4. **Results Presentation**
- Results are displayed in the Streamlit interface, including:
  - Original text under review
  - AI-driven suggestions
  - Shari'ah compliance status
  - Inter-standard consistency status

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install Python 3.10 or higher.
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to a `.env` file:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
